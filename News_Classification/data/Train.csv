parri firm over gerrard listen to the full interview on sport on five and the bbc sport websit from gmt but parri speak exclus to bbc sport also admit gerrard who ha been constantli link with chelsea will have the final say on hi futur he told bbc five live steven is abov money he is the futur of liverpool it doesn matter if it or we will not accept offer but we are also realist enough to know we can keep steven against hi will on the subject of liverpool financ parri also reveal the club is readi to explor the possibl of sponsorship deal for it propos new stadium and respond to critic from bbc sport pundit and former liverpool stalwart alan hansen he insist talk on new invest are ongo but ad the door ha not close on sharehold and lifelong fan steve morgan parri join liverpool as chief execut in juli from similar role at the premier leagu there have been sever high and low dure hi time in charg at anfield and he had busi summer overse the arriv of new manag rafael benitez and manag to hold on to steven gerrard on the subject of liverpool captain and prize asset parri reveal real madrid did ask for an option on the england midfield man dure negoti for striker fernando morient he said they were look for way of say they got more out of the deal for fernando morient but the respons to real madrid wa the same steven is not for sale but when ask if gerrard would be liverpool player on the first day of next season parri said sincer hope he will be steven know my view he know rafa view we have re affirm recent to steven that we are tri to build team around him we crave success as much as he doe we know he ambiti and nobodi can argu with that think steven would dearli love to win thing with liverpool more than he like to do anyth els we all want to see progress by next season he not alon in that there are lot of other player who feel the same so we all have common aim it is expect chelsea will test liverpool with plu bid in the summer but parri claim he will be in no mood to listen there have been lot of open secret about steven most of which have been complet myth it is suggest we had deal tie up last summer we didn had an offer last summer parri explain we had told chelsea that as far as we were concern he wa not for sale and we didn want to sell him in realiti it didn go beyond that mayb there will be an offer in the summer mayb there won our posit is we want steven to stay but we are also realist enough and have enough respect for steven and he ha enough respect for us to know that it is hi decis that will be crucial you are not go to keep player like steven against hi will that just doesn work but ani idea we are go to accept offer for steven and then tell him by the way we ve decid to sell you is not on the agenda you can forget that parri is current in the process of finalis fund for liverpool new stadium in stanley park which is set to open in and he confess arsen deal with emir to sponsor their new ground complet with name right ha given the anfield club seriou food for thought he said have to say histor it is someth have been against and have been on record as say that but think the size of the arsen deal is real eye open would say in the past deal have been done frankli far too cheapli and it just hasn even been worth contempl but the arsen deal is the sort of deal that caus you to draw breath and say wow that interest my person point of view is that would find it hell of lot more palat than share stadium some liverpool fan would find such move highli controversi but parri counter recognis it would be an emot issu for mani support but you look at the amount of money avail and it could go into the team if it wa the right partner how strong an issu is it time will tell think the stadium will alway be anfield not least becaus of where it is but do we need to investig the possibl of sponsorship think it would be remiss not to that not to say we have made decis that we will go down that road but think it is clearli someth we have to explor on the subject of possibl new invest parri reveal liverpool are still in negoti with mysteri investor with rumour of interest from the middl east that prompt the withdraw of tycoon steve morgan who got frustrat by fail bid and what he claim wa indecis by the board he also accus liverpool of use him as stalk hors to attract other bid but parri explain steve ha never been use as stalk hors there no need and that is not the way we do busi we had discuss with steve over the cours of think we came close to conclud deal in the summer but it didn happen quit genuin the new interest did appear rel late in the day just prior to the agm in decemb and as have said it wa of such potenti magnitud and that potenti is so excit we felt we had to evalu it we are still evalu it steve interest wa taken veri much on it own merit hi enthusiasm for the club is there for all to see and who know what the next few month will hold the door isn close on anyth we had perfectli sensibl dialogu with steve last year we have common interest in make liverpool success that dream we all share so as far as concern the door is not close would take if we had no invest but if we did keep him as for the stadium if it get us cash what differ doe it make realli for gerrard don care who you are the director would take the money and it is the way it should be we cannot let that sum of money go despit gerrard qualiti through cleverli word statement the club ha effect forc gerrard to publicli make the decis for himself which think is the right thing to do critic time for liverpool with regard to gerrard ideal we would want to secur hi futur to the club for the long term am hope he doesn walk out of the club like michael owen did for veri littl cash realist would allow rafa to complet rebuild the squad howev if we can afford to do thi and keep gerrard we will be better for it would howev be happi with gerrard transfer for ani fee over parri statement are clever in that ani futur gerrard transfer cannot be constru as lack of ambit by the club to not tri and keep their best player up the ant is anoth smart move by parri would keep gerrard no amount of money could replac hi obviou love of the club and determin to succeed the key is if gerrard come out and say that he is happi clearli if he isn then we would be foolish not to sell the worri thing is who would

although robbi william is good perform that angel isn realli that good song it certainli isn anywher near as good as love will tear us apart by joy divis or wuther height by kate bush angel is fantast song all credit to robbi william and guy chamber it song that will be play forev and bridg all age group robbi did in no way deserv that mantl whenev we have these award it is alway artist from the past five year that seem to win the best of the best we forget about the late and earli for exampl they weren cool at the time but becaus they are cool again now show that the song have greater longev than peopl think ye angel is the best song sinc the past year becaus it touch the soul as it carri lot of mean ve alway dislik angel intens believ it to be symbol of the gener capac of british pre teen teen and middl age women to accept low qualiti low aspir music as classic songwrit it orribl it seem obviou to me that peopl who like robbi are peopl who don particularli like music all that much folk without collect folk who have never engag in that mad one experi when fall under the spell of pop music angel add noth it is mere an irrit distract wasp that refus to go away on summer afternoon picnic what dread result if you vote for it you should feel asham of yourself you probabl onli know dozen song or so don you so where do get off appli thi uninform filter and cast thi ridicul vote booo hisss angel best song you are kid right last five year might be will to accept but no way did whoever vote for thi actual have ani music knowledg prior to say realli quit insult to the british music industri of the past quarter of centuri no surpris about robbi william consid the list where on earth did the nomin list come from compil by an eleven year old girl perhap mean will young come on what load of crap best song in the last year don think so what about all the real artist out there over the last year the list is endless but robbi william doesn even come close what joke that song ha becom such bane to me that have develop pavlovian respons to the word angel where thrash around and scream no no no no no until someon tell me the radio off whi half bake cheesi ditti like angel which ha becom the anthem for million of romant sop think how mani time it wa sung on pop idol for exampl and by whom should be vote the best song of the past year is beyond me if thi is the song against which all other are judg then musician may as well give up whi do we reward mediocr so highli in thi countri the initi list wa veri weak anyway but angel the best song of the last year think not didn realiz radio had so mani listen under the age of peopl have such short memori great song ye but the best of the last year not chanc think the person as oppos to the song ha been vote for here the great british public at work again it mediocr sentiment and safe song grant it not too bad either but can it stand up against anyth by the smith in particular how soon is now or anyth from the stone rose first album nope no becaus not femal and not ok like robbi and angel is decent song but it is no way the best song of the past year the shortlist wasn great but him win it is joke predict and laughabl the success of angel at thi year brit reflect poorli on the state of british music over the last year the british public are brainwash by the corpor pulp that is presnet to them as cut edg music and true talent is be sadli miss whilst angel is popular song it is not even the best song in robbi repertoir never mind best song of the last year am huge robbi fan and love that song but think there are lot more outstand song music out there that influenc music today unfortun they were left out of the list have radio listen even heard of joy divis band who through two album have had bigger impact on music and continu to do so over the last year than robbi william ever will no doubt about it there not song done by anyon with more emot and feel some peopl will adopt their slightli snobbi stanc but angel ha hit home with far larger audienc than ani other song it should have been joy divis those guy have play an influenti part in shape modern day music while angel remain yet anoth pop song sincer do not believ that in year from now the most influenti artist will argu that robbi william inspir their art in the way that the byrd the beatl and nick drake have done for music today ye think it brilliantli written song with differ mean to differ peopl there were other great song in the categori but somebodi had to win robbi wa deserv winner am astound that such second rate record ha beaten such line up of amaz song it terribl song vote for by the mass who don have the brain to appreci innov and excit music the best song of the past year realli come on thi is sure joke no think need long lie down it just goe to show that the british public do not have clue about good qualiti music when they pick robbi william over the beauti talent kate bush and joy divis suppos it confirm one thing the british public are consist dull lt no offenc robbi but pleeeas there must be thousand better song than formul cheesi pop song for kid no one agre with thi and quit frankli it is an embarass to the integr of british music and further nail in the coffin think robbi deserv it he ha been the most icon of ani star we have had in britain sinc john lennon and is an idol to million worldwid anybodi who say he doesn deserv it is jealou of hi success the onli real challeng wa queen but hey anoth one bite the dust obvious all the karaok singer in the uk vote for it if thi is the best song of the last year then the british music industri is in troubl sure robbi is talent and produc excel materi but thi is not the best record sad day for music it not the type of music normal like but even as diehard rock fan recognis that it is good song and appela to most peopl that whi it ha been vote best song of the last year it good all rounder just like robbi best song in year sinc confus angel isn bad song it nice catchi formula anthem that tick all the box but thi is not great music if anyth it regress bland even suppos it just more evid of how redund the brit award have becom grant angel is good song howev it realli wasn up against ani other proper competit the queen song wa lacklust and apart from kate bush the other choic were pathet also whi weren the stone there david bowi etc there are so mani greater song than angel wonder if it wa simpli the fact that robbi wasn get more award so they had to make one up for him best song of the last year what ridiculu concept and an even more ridicul winner sigh on the upsid at least it wasn bohemian rhapsodi for which we should all be thank angel is without doubt great song but realli don think it deserv the titl of best song in year perhap the vote had more to do with teenag opinion on robbi goodlook than the actual song don get me wrong not disput hi look but there are more deserv winner it would have been travesti had angel not won without angel robbi william may well not be where he is now and britain would have been depriv of one of it most charismat and talent perform artist it ha to be seen perform live with peopl sing along to be fulli appreci well done rob find it hard to believ that angel is the best we have to show for the past year rapidli redifin best in my own head now to mean most gratuit play at wed and funer becaus peopl think it ha deep mean what about britpop blur oasi sued pulp not onli make fantast song but also make chang do someth differ whi must best alway come down to most commerci popular ve noth against robbi actual like hi music but how can thi possibl be the best song from the last year the brit ha prove to be noth more than bargain tool between the pop mogul to boost band profil and record sale the same goe with the scissor sister think thi is superb record and thoroughli deserv the newcom award but the album come no where near new record neither are they in the same leagu onc again there have been some baffl discis made they are not for artis reason but for profit no surpris realli it vote for by the gener public sinc when did they have tast in music person find angel by robbi william to be one of the most irrit song have ever heard it absolut deserv to win it is song that ha unit the gener and will continu to be play for mani year to come it an absolut joke howev most of the origin were veri poor choic as well all in all pretti pointless exercis the song is overplay and oversentiment out of the rather poor five choic that were left it should have gone to either joy divis or queen suppos we should be thank that it didn end up in the hand of will young though although it ha nostalgia valu there is no way it deserv to win everybodi know the word to bohemian rhapsodi noth compar etc much better song and more timeless give it to someon with real talent although angel is good song think that anyon with the slightest music tast will realis that thi is not the best song of the last year thi is just anoth exampl of record compani manipul to keep an artist in the public eye whi not give him an award for the greatest pair of trouser if that

verita is parti that doesn believ in lie and spin but the truth of the matter is it complet useless due to proport represent there is no chanc that verita will have ani chanc in claim power and chang the two hors race trend in my opinion thi is just public stunt which ha just been use as smoke screen for hi anti islam slur which got him sack from the televis think that hi view regard immigr are share by mani it realli is time that the uk govern ceas to be paper tiger on thi issu in addit as an ashfield constitu would be more than interest in kilroy silk oppos geoff hoon good to see the parti of the right splinter in the way the parti of the left have alway done let hope kilroy silk ukip and the euro sceptic wing of the tori parti all fade further into obscur so we can have some truth in the debat about europ we benefit enorm from our membership of the eu we need to be at the heart of europ lead it and drive it to where we as countri want to go not run away from it all mouth and trouser clown troubl is ani vote he collect may just end up help new labour into third term whatev kilroy silk and ukip do none of their anti european polici have ani relev outsid middl england thi new parti might gain support from right wing england but will have littl impact in wale or scotland hope thi all thi fight within euro sceptic parti will allow them to slip out of the way and get peopl vote for real polit parti which address more than one issu england need europ to surviv and as soon as peopl realis thi the better we can reli on the usa forev at last an impetu for increas the like turn out for the elect the elector is disillus with british polit kilroy ha one agenda the uk and ll be vote for him both ukip and rk are repres of small minded and lack of vision for the whole of humankind the interest of human and the world lie so much beyond the scope of these peopl bicker that who in the overal scheme of thing realli care about their petti tiff mani peopl believ you kilroy you may even believ yourself but switch hors midstream and then bad mouth the steed that got you halfway serious diminish your credibl the veri idea of polit parti born out of such neg feel as eurosceptic or british supremaci is nauseat one can onli hope the public recognis these extremist for what they are and shun them at the poll ve alway thought that kilroy silk wa self publicis egotist and thi news doe absolut noth to alter my opinion brilliant about time thi countri had plausibl parti have seen the recent bbc documentari and wit the thoroughli disgrac chauvinist behaviour of number of senior ukip figur can well understand whi kilroy silk feel embarrass to be associ with such peopl hope the ukip member who are interest in the polit debat will support hi action fantast news pro european now have far less to worri about from the right the conserv are as confus as they have been sinc the mid and the extrem anti european are fractur themselv into splinter group that split ani vote they might get in local european and gener elect robert kilroy silk ego and vaniti are hi own and hi support worst enemi as euro enthusiast could not be more delight by kilroy silk behaviour he took parti that wa just build up head of steam and have expos it to ridicul by attempt coup etat he is now set about the seriou busi of divid it in two the closer to straight down the middl the better as far as am concern but in ani eventu the two sceptic parti will exhaust their energi fight each other if everi politician with ambit to lead their parti resort to form their own for that purpos we have ballot paper mile long you ve got to hand it to kilroy silk for hi sheer arrog and suprem self belief whilst not be great fan of kilroy do agre with hi comment about the ukip leadership and like him am also leav ukip believ countless opportun have been lost to discredit the eu and to show our peopl what belong to the eu realli mean the eu comment last week about michael howard plan to reform immigr show how littl we govern our own countri when they can turn round and say immigr is matter for the eu and not individu member state the sooner we leav thi corrupt super state the better doe anyon els think that it is iron that euro sceptic kilroy silk ha use latin name for hi new parti rather than good old british name is thi indic of the man contradictori vain and pompou think mr kilroy silk ha got veri good point british polit ha becom too pc and as result ha no straight talk honest strong politician they are all interest in their own career and not the peopl who put them in power as result feel our democraci is be abus and want it stop if mr kilroy silk live up to half hi promis he will get my vote honestli who realli care man with tan leav parti with no plan to set up parti with no idea as one of kilroy silk east midland constitu hope those who vote for him are proud to have been taken in by such charm vacuiti feel insult by have him repres me in the european parliament ukip tri hard to accommod robert kilroy silk but he made it clear that onli control of it would satisfi him someon so keen on complet control wa bound to fall foul of ukip democrat natur kilroy is an abl commun and capabl politician in exactli the way those who lead ukip are not he tri to make it work but they didn seem to want to grow up he wa left in the posit of have to defend their gaff to the media thi new parti seem logic next step for kilroy good luck to the man say oh pleas thi is an amus irrelev there is absolut no chanc of either of these parti commun sensibl and construct euroscept argument they will play key part in win the countri round to the idea of reform more democrat more dynam europ union futur gener will thank him for hi ridicul the refresh thing about robert is that he is open honest and straight what other politician can claim thi have suspicion that he talk for larger part of the elector that hi critic would like shall be vote for him the elector of the east midland vote not for kilroy silk but for the ukip kilroy silk wa made an mep becaus of hi posit on the ukip parti list he ha no mandat to repres the area and should resign from the european parliament wouldn write off kilroy silk while he clown and one man band at the moment he populist and that alway danger the man clearli ha an enorm ego and look at our current polit master that seem to be one of the factor in success good luck to kilroy though think he is do more harm than good for both hi new parti and ukip becaus their vote base is not strong enough for both parti to be success and at the moment ukip have the upper hand while verita are start from squar one and fight somewhat uphil battl the man onc found cring worthi on day time tv could well turn out to be my countri knight in shine armour he express view which are now more than common amongst societi today but peopl are almost too scare to express them kilroy silk ha secur my vote and mani more like me what more look forward to the day when he claim victori wreck the eu and rescu my great nation without hair out of place and hi tan as perfect as ever great stuff the longer the uk dither over europ the richer we in ireland becom as the onli english speak countri fulli commit to europ oh and send us over those hard work immigr our economi need them thi is just what the europhil pray for as the main euroscept parti ukip should tri to resolv it differ with kilroy to show unit front and give the uk public seriou polit voic against europ have multipl parti with the same view point just split the vote further thank good that kilroy silk ha gone now ukip at least ha chanc in the elect it is veri sad to see the caus of britain regain it proper relationship with europ damag by thi split within ukip robert kilroy silk could have lot to offer instead we have split parti and damag caus under the present elector system peopl must work togeth and small parti have no hope of represent last summer ukip achiev major advanc partli and onli partli due to kilroy silk it is great shame thi ha been dissip in in fight ukip ha wide platform of polici not just withdraw from the eu thi kilroy silk conveni ignor in the comment surround the launch of hi own parti neither the english democrat nor the new parti were interest in let him join them and take over their leadership speak volum verita is the begin of the end for kilroy silk if he believ in truth and democraci then he and the two assembl member should resign and forc by elect to stand on their own platform rather than thi backdoor approach to polit of be elect for one parti then defect to anoth so ukip wa good enough for him to lead not good enough for him to follow interest that parti commit to plain speak should have latin name everi opinion poll point to an overwhelm anti europ feel in thi countri kilroy silk could be on the verg of someth huge if he can broaden hi appeal beyond thi one issu he is an extrem abl commun with year of polit experi we want qualiti school top hospit clean and effici public transport punish that fit the crime limit asylum purg on bureaucraci and less tax it need courag and honesti two qualiti sadli lack in our politician kilroy silk may just have those veri qualiti recruit the right colleagu robert and your time may have come well if you cannot get enough limelight be an ordinari mp then go out and start up your own parti it all flash and no real polici here let hope thi is the start of both ukip and kilroy silk slip into obscur verita the name will doom it but perhap am wrong for sure all

what price for trust pc secur you can now buy trust comput but can we realli trust the pc vendor ask technolog analyst bill thompson if you have recent bought an ibm thinkvantag comput dell optiplex or one of whole rang of laptop from toshiba hp compaq or samsung then you may have got more for your money than you realis insid your shini new pc is an extra chip call the trust platform modul tpm that can be use for rang of hardwar base secur featur eventu the tpm will be built into the main processor itself and if the trust comput group ha it way then you will find one in everi piec of hardwar you own from mobil phone to tv set top box to children toy but for the moment it is separ piec of hardwar provid enhanc secur featur to program that know how to use them and as part of well design network system it can provid lot more secur than we enjoy today big advantag of the tpm is that it is hardwar base at the moment most of us reli on softwar to keep our inform safe and secur it might be password protect user account data encrypt program or firewal but it all reli on program code run on an inher insecur processor hardwar secur is less common even if it is lot safer thi is partli becaus it is more expens to give someon smartcard than password but also becaus it more work for user system administr and manag as result we settl for second best so when it come to comput secur trust system could be major step forward after all if you have laptop that will onli run program that have been digit sign then it will be lot harder for viru writer to get their malici code to run and if all your file are lock automat then even if you get your comput stolen your person data will be safeguard at the moment support for trust hardwar is not built into major oper system instead you have to use special softwar like hp protecttool or wave system embassi thi provid file encrypt password manag and ident protect usual for busi user who connect to compani network full support for the trust comput specif will not be avail from microsoft until the next releas of window longhorn thi will includ what microsoft in typic act of obscurant call the next gener secur comput base and it will give user level program access to the trust comput hardwar when that happen we can expect to see lot of public around the new capabl and no doubt the window secur centr will encourag user to turn on their trust comput capabl just as they turn on their firewal howev there is downsid to the increas secur from virus spywar and data theft that thi will provid becaus the trust comput base is also use to make digit right manag drm system more secur thi will give content provid lot more control over what we can do with music movi and book that we have bought from them we have seen recent how allow digit right manag servic into our live can lead to unwelcom consequ user of appl itun use to be abl to stream the music they had brought to up to five other itun user great way of let your mate

abil to play song download from real harmoni servic on your ipod appl can do thi becaus they wrote the softwar and they control the right manag onc it is embed in trust hardwar it will be even harder for dedic programm to find their way around these restrict and give us back the fair use right that should be guarante under copyright law similarli user of tivo digit video record have found that they cannot record some show and other programm that they have record are automat delet after day thi happen becaus of chang that tivo have made to their softwar and the user cannot control it one wonder whether hardwar base drm will work for those who believ that lock down digit content is bad idea and that the flexibl of copyright law is someth that should be embrac and not taken away it will not work becaus of the fundament flaw at the heart of the system in order for the purchas to view the content it ha to be unlock onc it is unlock then someon somewher will figur out way to make copi

dysfunct sens of realiti an obsess eq player doe not consid the game to be real ani more than for exampl an obsess automot tinker consid their car to be human if mmorpg have uniqu danger in term of encourag obsess behaviour it is not that they creat an absorb virtual world but rather that they can be easili access the problem here doe not lie with the natur of game but with the natur of modern hour cultur the problem with these so call mmorpg is that you can never realli complet them there alway anoth quest to do few of my friend have onli had about hour sleep sinc it wa releas friday championship manag consum my life for year one particular session start at about pm on sunday paus for brief sleep at am on the monday and after visit to univers for class restart at about midday for

franz man seek govern help franz ferdinand frontman alex kaprano ha call for more govern help for musician while take part in an edinburgh lectur discuss for ani cultur output to thrive there need to be some kind of state input to that as well he said but kaprano warn against musician be too close link with mp at the univers of edinburgh event think the role of musician is to question politician rather than to go to bed with them he said kaprano join the prestigi lectur seri to discuss scotland role in make st centuri music there are element of our music output which requir susten becaus they aren self suffici he said but so call commerci music would benefit from invest as well he warn musician against be alli to particular parti howev don know if have tea with politician is alway good idea kaprano and hi glasgow four piec band have been nomin for five prize at next week brit award includ best group and best album their self titl debut album won last year mercuri music prize and spawn three top singl he told the strong audienc at the univers reid hall that musician should listen to wide rang of music and should not be restrict by stereotyp we say like thi becaus listen to nirvana and korn am troubl individu riddl with angst becaus listen to chopin and debussi listen to kyli minogu and scissor sister becaus upbeat and like to parti listen to wagner becaus like the smell of napalm in the morn kaprano said there wa gener hostil toward classic music ad there is veri littl done to break that hostil other than classic fm he conclud we defin ourselv as nation by the way we encourag our creativ fellow speaker and classic compos jame macmillan agre we need to rediscov our abil to listen previou speaker at the edinburgh lectur seri have includ former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev and author professor stephen hawk kaprano describ hi appear on wednesday as more daunt by long way than their upcom brit perform don realli care about the brit he said it go to be great to go down but have actual had to exercis part of my brain tonight think the govern should do more to help up and come artist be discov by scrap the entertain licenc for live venu also they should do more to help independ record label have louder voic within an industri domin by commercialis major label rather than expect the govern the taxpay to fork out whi don some of the megastar put someth back in some of britain wealthiest peopl are musician who have rake it in from album concert etc there are far more import demand on govern fund if they can fund footbal whi not fund music area of the art are fund by govern and lotteri grant so whi not music we alreadi have the opera receiv huge grant and it would clearli be benefici for divers in music to have the same opportun in other area of the music the onli problem would be how to judg what merit state cash the govern ha enough problem fund school and health servic if alex kaprano genuin think multi billion pound industri should also have govern fund then hi own educ wa serious lack and more money should be put into that as scot live in england appreci the valu of scottish music and cultur be success so can see no problem with it franz ferdinand travi and snow patrol are just recent exampl of the success scottish music can have in the world so we should do what we scot are good at and support our own good think the issu is more fundament should the govern be spend money on subsidis multi million pound industri when health and educ are in such sorri state the answer is most definit no those peopl who are lucki enough to pursu their passion to get their pay chequ shouldn be look for govern subsidi know that if wa lucki enough to be abl to pursu my dream of show jump would want to financ myself until wa in posit to pursu corpor sponsorship ye the govern should fund music it bring joy to the mass there are alreadi thousand of state fund musician out there sit around twiddl their thumb on the new deal get the govern even more involv would onli wast money that could be put to better use as long as the govern wa fund real talent it would be great move would hate to see more pop idol type fund of music though as it would onli serv to reinforc the stereotyp that alex talk about onli if the propos make financi sens franz ferdinand must be pay seriou amount of tax on their record sale if they had govern grant to get start they have more than paid it back by now so the treasuri would be make far more than it paid out howev the govern ha better thing to spend it money on than to give chariti to everyon who decid they re musician the govern shouldn fund music it should invest in music and those invest should be treat like ani other invest think the govern need to provid facil and for young group and band to form and practis the equip is not cheap and can be well beyond the mean of mani peopl howev do feel thi should be the extent of their role to provid the condit for the talent to flourish and let it go from there do agre that the govern should help to fund music but there is also respons held by record compani they gener alway opt for the tri and test and tend not to want to break ani mould or risk lose ani money which ultim the director are in the busi for if label were more will to put money forward toward smaller breakthrough act then the govern wouldn have to fork out great deal yeah whi not music should be govern fund particularli the work of modern compos and veteran band artist and stuff pop music pretti much rule the earth so more attent should go to the other fratern agre with fund the art to make it more access to the public but am not convinc that pop music requir financi support from the taxpay there is great deal of money gener through pop music perhap tax on pop could be plough into the public perform of other form of music for everyon to enjoy perhap we could financi penalis realli bad pop idol style music that is the music industri sector without ani artist merit or origin whatsoev and that which is specif design to line the pocket of music produc call it tax on music pollut if you like though realli like franz ferdinand have to disagre with mr kaprano onc govern get their hand into the privat sector it will destroy the creativ and possibl controversi avenu the artist pursu mani year ago thi wa the case with the us nea when the govern start to

increas in live cost have not been match by an increas in pay for exampl job did in plymouth wa underpaid to an equival worker in exet by an hour hope the increas in the minimum wage will bring in to

quit prepar for raft of bribe to come from the govern befor the elect and raft of tax afterward they are play us for the fool they think we are thi is extrem bad news for ani busi whether they are small and medium enterpris or even larg compani by increas overhead for busi there will be an almost certain rise in cost to the consum who while they openli welcom the idea of an increas in the minimum wage are the same peopl who still want to buy that shirt or that pair of trainer for next to noth the extra cost thi increas will bring will onli be reflect in the price of the good we buy which in turn will onli serv to discourag compani from set up busi in the uk or encourag those compani alreadi base here to look elsewher the jubil felt by low paid worker here will soon give way to

busi complain might like to take look at corpor pay sharehold payout and profit befor wonder if pay live wage is realli control factor in the viabil of their firm am all for lift the minimum wage of worker to reason level but we have to accept that with thi will come competit from oversea worker also small busi will have to be abl to afford thi manpow cost we are alreadi see sweep chang in it work be lost to india where peopl are paid much less it is difficult for me to understand that onli five year ago cheap labour abroad wa classifi as sweat shop but now we are told it is global competit with our manufactur industri in seriou declin the countri cannot be entir servic industri without someth tangibl to serv there ha to be someth at the top of the food chain and that is manufactur the whole pictur need to be look at thi is great news but that might be becaus work for minimum wage seem good idea and will hope be an incent to those who live to claim to actual get job when you can earn more from claim than you can from work there is no incent perhap step in the right direct if the tuc get their way veri larg number of sme will have to close thi will put more peopl out of work how then will the govern fudg the unemploy figur the govern know it is not big busi that keep the economi go but the sme but we alway get overlook they will onli take notic if these larg corpor close and move to other countri after all they are predominantli own by foreign compani we are specialist compani but with these increas have alreadi had an effect on us and we have lost work anoth one will close us while delight for those on low pay that thi increas is be put forward am extrem concern at the implic for small busi as an employe for small nurseri know thi increas will caus great hardship for my employ who ha been unabl to increas salari for higher paid employe becaus of last octob increas for the lower paid employe who were origin be paid slightli abov the minimum but are now on the minimum thi latest increas of an hour will caus even more financi hardship if the rate rise to then can forese mani small busi have to pay off employe the increas in minimum wage will have seriou effect on my busi although we pay abov the minimum level we will have to increas our pay rate to maintain the differenti the rais is well abov inflat and without signific increas in sale it will mean that will not be take on new member of staff as plan and will be look to reduc the total hour work by the other member of staff overtim be the first to go current employ staff whose wage mirror the nation minimum wage increas abov inflat are fine but all of my busi is conduct with local author who will not accept abov inflat rise in my servic deliveri of my cost are labour the other aspect that is alway hidden is that the threshold for tax credit do not move in line with these increas so that all that happen is that employe tax credit support is reduc by the amount of the increas therebi save the govern money but increas the financi burden on small to medium busi it is veri good that the govern ha decid to increas the minimum wage thi should hope motiv peopl to undertak the lower statu job know about thi great idea don bother get qualif laze about at school no need to do anyth other than attend so your parent don get fine becaus rememb when you do eventu start work doesn matter how lazi you are you ll be guarante decent wage the one who suffer are the employ hope that if industri and busi have to pay thi new rate that mr blair and mr brown will increas tax allow and rais nation insur threshold so that the treasuri won take some of thi increas off the peopl they say they are help or is thi just anoth form of stealth tax on busi through the back door don believ in the minimum wage at all think job should creat their own wage valu and that if peopl want higher wage they should earn them now befor everyon think that am some rich kid can assur you am not came from veri much work class background and start work year ago on youth opportun program earn per week work hard went to colleg part time got my level and degre better myself now earn figur salari did that through hard work and get off my backsid minimum wage just make peopl complac to ashley of swindon when you earn per week it wa worth someth these day that would need to be near to to have the equival buy power might add that thank to success govern hold down the tax allow threshold below inflat peopl earn the minimum wage are pay tax that they never would have done year ago at equival wage in my day type argument are view that belong in the your day year ago as graduat work for minimum wage welcom ani increas of pay can get disagre with ashley swindon say have to work harder to get more pay have my gcse level and degre and have chosen to work for small busi that can afford the wage should be get should be on at least what get but they can afford it we all work hard but the money is just not there but on the plu side love my job and wouldn chang it just to get more pay as an employ of staff in sever shop the last rise in the minimum wage cost my compani an addit per year these next rise will cost me more have to get the money from somewher so pass it on to custom so no one realli win in the end in answer to emma from sleaford regard no one realli win in the end on the contrari mr blair win he win becaus he obvious ha announc thi to be vote winner and hi treasuri win becaus as an employ you will know that the amount of tax and nation insur that the govern will receiv from all the minimum wage increas will rise and of cours not onli will be pay out higher wage but as an employ higher employ ni contribut as well if the minimum wage increas again and if it hit anywher near the mark there will be more peopl on the employ line and one more small busi go bankrupt name mine think of us employ as well mr blair we are not all big corpor earn million all worker should be
