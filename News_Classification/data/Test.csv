soon receiv their own costli makeov with screen version of the team the duke of hazzard and even blake seven on the card nostalgia is clearli big busi but some critic complain that these expens take on icon seri of yesteryear do not match up to our fond memori of the origin the new version of the magic roundabout which will be releas as sprung in the us replac the stop motion model of the tv show with polish comput gener anim in similar fashion the thunderbird use human actor and special effect in place of the origin puppet and model the film are squar pitch at younger audienc pop star robbi william and kyli minogu provid voic in the magic roundabout while the now defunct boy band bust perform the thunderbird theme song but while some review have been won over there ha nonetheless been signific backlash thi cg anim adventur airbrush the sli charm and trippi which made the stop motion roundabout cult hit write stella papamichael on the bbc movi site and the recent puppet comedi team america world polic wa in part provok by it director outrag that gerri anderson thunderbird wa remad without it signatur mannequin dan jolin review editor of empir magazin say classic children tv show have built in audienc that make them ideal for reinvent can understand whi peopl are take these intellectu properti and repackag them for the kid of today but think it backfir what next the clanger on some distant planet with some giant cgi soup dragon chase after them despit thunderbird disappoint global box offic perform the film cost but onli recoup the nostalgia craze show no sign of abat it can therefor be onli matter of time befor some other tv favourit receiv the hollywood treatment after the success of garfield the movi britain shabbi tabbi sure deserv hi own film vehicl with onli episod made of the seri there is plenti of room to explor the live of the pink cat professor yaffl and the mice of the marvel mechan mous organ furri recycl have alreadi had one big screen outing wombl free but with environment issu still occupi our thought it is high time they made comeback advanc in special effect technolog could do wonder for the bbc supernatur comedi and the success of pirat of the caribbean must sure herald comeback for tv most popular cartoon buccan it might also remind viewer the lewd charact name often associ with the show never actual exist the magic roundabout is out in the uk on februari how about bring catweazl to the big screen he could give gandalf run for hi money thundercat love it should be fun to see on the big screen if some effort is put in it will bring my youth back get your hand off the clanger is noth sacr make movi version of the banana split what about keanu reev and richard gere in remak of the wooden top or perhap robbi william could get hi much moot act career off the ground by take on the role of andi pandi you forgot to mention the grearest of them all danger mous but then again it couldn be better than the origin seri could it it alway nice to see these old toon re releas but after the abysm thunderbird movi and the song think ve been complet put off just leav these classic alon as good memori think remak are good idea as the world move on peopl tend to look more and more into the past to thing that make them feel safe believ thi is the whole reason retro ha becom so popular as long as remak doe justic to the origin then all it can do is creat wider audienc and possibl entic new gener of person to enjoy and reviv and old seri person like to see cartoon such as transform thundercat and get full hollywood remak leav them alon whi ruin someth that we all have veri fond memori of in the first place the thunderbird film wa apal not patch on the puppet seri grew up with and the magic roundabout will never be the same without the voic of eric thompson love to see transform with real actor and cgi and make it at least rate part of the reason for the success of such classic as the magic roundabout wa that the charact were not the sweet and cuddli creatur that you would expect they were moodi sarcast and rather human just look at the pictur of the anim for the new film show that these characterist have not been preserv dougal never smile like that film of thi sort have an unfortun habit of disneyfi everth and they just lose the real magic that made the show special in the first place have fond memori of bod not least of which becaus look like him and would like to see someon attempt to make it into film it got all the right materi for an american blockbust no plot and no stori bod would like be play by tom cruis and would undoubtedli have girlfriend or two it all veri well and good remak these classic tv show and film with all the latest technolog for new audienc but for me lot of the origin charm is lost when they do thi and seem more like money make exercis to cash in on the origin success of the programm than reinvent or improv it it mayb that to an audienc who have never seen the origin they can watch them without prejudic but to peopl who have grown up with all these show such as thunderbird and magic roundabout which are part of our childhood they are never go to live up to expect it doe pose the question though that with all the long line of remak be made are film maker run out of origin idea all can say is bring back danger mous probabl the greatest kid show ever recent re watch some episod and realis that there wa level of humour shown in danger mous that wa complet lost on me when wa child there wa new captain pugwash cartoon made coupl of year back again like so mani of these nostalgia programm the anim thi time comput creat flat cell like anim fail to match the origin cut out paper techniqu for invent and wa woefulli inadequ we live in sampl world the music industri ha been pluder past decad for inspir clip sound from year ago is much cheaper and easier that do someth new seem that the film and tv is do the same now it just cheaper to take idea from the past and rework them rather than be dare and tri someth new it got to be mr benn the stori line about man who chang in fanci dress shop step into door way and appear in anoth time and place would be amaz if they got decent produc and writer the stori line could be great and who to play the lead role well if it wa comedi then it would have to be someon like steve martin if it go to be an adventur then johnni depp play role similar to the pirat of the caribbean charact muffin the mule perhap after all granni and grandpa go to the cinema as well you know whi can the british film industri tri make gerri anderson ufo or captain scarlet or saphir and steel or the tomorrow peopl in today media it seem the past is the futur tv show such as battlestar galactica have new remak dj are sampl or re work and music even comput game from year ago are get modern re work person think it show that no one ha ani origin ani more whi not just leav our misti eye nostalgia alon mari mungo and midg but of cours for most of the episod the lift would be out of order and they would have to use the stair plu would mari be more of vicki pollard charact as she live in high rise council block yeah but no but wasn even there like to see mr benn with brad pitt in the titl role sean conneri could play the mysteri costum shop owner it demonstr profound lack of imagin in today film maker that they continu tri to remak and remodel the past in an effort to cash in on nostalgia there are plani of modern children book that would make excel film or tv programm whi not use them instead of rehash the past mr benn with rowan atkinson as the lead would have love to see dungeon dragon made but unfortun the film that it wa made into didn come up to scratch the onli one that isn to be remad as yet is thundercat which like to see an expat live in norway and recent went through period of buy the dvd of mani of my favourit children program for my daughter my dearest wish howev is to see featur length version of noggin the nog appear on the big screen veri scandinavian rainbow believ that children classic should be left well alon and will not be surpris if the magic roundabout doe not do well at the box offic especi sinc it will be go up against the spongebob squarep movi popular among children becaus it origin witti and modern the magic roundabout will never appeal to the children of today as it did all those mani year ago how about classic like chorlton and the wheeli rentaghost terrahawk bod oh the list could go on and on if transform movi is inde on the card then ll be the first one on amazon buy copi eagerli wait at the front door with frothi mouth and nervou twitch repackag my childhood and sell it to me at an extortion price don care till then ll have to make do with the citreon advert luv to see willow the wisp on the big screen but sadli without the late kenneth william do the voic it wouldnt be the same and who rememb trap door voic by the late willi rushden superb children programm could morph hold hi own in big screen movi or even jami and the magic torch hmmmmm could go on and on danger mous at show my age noggin the nog wa one of the best children program the problem with bring it to the big screen is that no one could approach oliv postgat wonder voic so in gener leav well alon the origin are good becaus they are of their time and the method use are an integr part of the stori just imagin what could be achiev by use cgi in remak of fingerbob the alreadi disturb hand antic of the beard hippi yoffi could take on whole new level with more life like fingermous bob the builder postman pat and fireman sam togeth in an epic adventur of fire post and brick in the ultim struggl to save the women they love from the evil clown krusti and gobo will they triumph or will they fail miser find out thi fall one puppet show that person would love to see made into live action movi is joe it would be worth the price of admiss alon to see the larg screen version of joe car of cours gerri anderson is rich seam of materi worthi of big screen big budget action it wa onli that thunderbird the movi wa target as children movi that realli let it down after all the children that rememb those show with such affect are now the parent of children themselv it onli becaus the peopl who were children when these programm were first shown have grown up and are plunder their childhood isn it hate to see bagpuss with perfect anim love that done in shed clunki and you couldn recreat the magic perhap if the remak were done in look around you mock authent style might be interest chorton and the wheeli or jami and hi magic torch that would be mega thi re gurgit of old film and tv show make me angri it is corpor lazi rest on the safeti of other peopl idea becaus it guarante to bring in the the same can be said of modern day pop band who releas other peopl materi will young etc the sad fact is nostalgia sell big buck in the short term the fact that they will be forgotten in month time is irrelev starski hutch henc the market is satur with thi mindless drivel but it can onli be stop if peopl stop buy it pray they never do remak of chorlton and the wheeli onli and don rememb the seri from when it wa on tv but have the set on dvd and it classic the fact it so great come from the fact that there were veri few special effect involv and compar to today stuff it look amateurish that the appeal though it so innoc like chorlton himself and it would be real shame if they did remak it,1

terror power expos tyranni the lord chancellor ha defend govern plan to introduc control order to keep foreign and british terrorist suspect under hous arrest where there isn enough evid to put them on trial lord falcon insist that the propos do not equat to polic state and strike balanc between protect the public against the threat of terror and uphold civil liberti but thriller writer frederick forsyth tell bbc news of hi person respons to the move there is mortal danger aim at the heart of britain or so say home secretari charl clark my reaction so what it is not that am cynic or just do not care care about thi countri veri much but in the year that have been aliv there ha not been one hour of one day of one month of one year when there ha not been threat aim at us my point is the british have alway cope without becom dictatorship we have cope with fear without becom state base on fear we have cope with threat without turn our countri into land of state threat but that is what the blair govern now seek to do creat tyranni to defend us from the al qaeda tyranni wa born on august the mortal threat back then wa scruffi littl austrian call adolf hitler week after my first birthday the threat had becom realiti we were at war my father wore uniform for five year after we yearn for peac at last but in winston churchil told us from the baltic to the adriat an iron curtain ha descend across europ behind the iron curtain anoth genocid psychopath anoth threat josef stalin trigger the cold war with the berlin blockad in my whole gener wa blight by it we were threaten by the nuclear holocaust the nuclear wind the nuclear winter we built shelter that would have shelter noth we spent our treasur on weapon instead of hospit we took silli precaut some fought it some march futil against it some pretend it wa not there the cold war last year but we remain parliamentari democraci by the earli seventi it wa terror as well al fatah black septemb red brigad but most of all for us the ira and the inla thirti more year policemen and women over soldier more than civilian dead but we won becaus even ira bomb could not forc us to becom tyranni that wa whi the tyrant lost civil right were infring as littl as humanli possibl evid had to be taken in secret to protect covert sourc ye and one judg no juri court had to be institut when juri were terroris inform had to be given immun from their own crime to win the bigger battl but habea corpu did not die right of appeal wa not abolish now the threat is islam fundament it leader want to destroy our societi so did the ira it is base and fund abroad so wa the ira it ha sleeper fanat insid our societi so did the ira it is extrem hard to penetr with our agent so wa the ira the prime mover are not easi to bring to trial neither were the ira but we did and without becom tyranni now the blair govern propos the law system of fascism and commun the citizen can be arrest and held without charg or trial not even on the care consider of an experienc judg but the whim of polit activist call govern minist to be protect from terror the govern say we must becom tyranni but tyranni is base on the citizen terror thi is not victori thi is defeat befor shot is fire an interest articl it good to see widen particip in the debat but suggest we move one step further our own bomb and bullet will can onli shatter peac becaus invad foreign nation imprison the innoc and hunt in the shadow cannot destroy an evil of the mind and hatr within the heart rather than focus upon effect we should consid the caus becaus terror doe not begin with bomb whi not tri foreign polici of compass it can onli enhanc our democraci and share our freedom agre with frederick forsyth we realli can deal with terror by turn britain into fascist state what we realli need is more honesti from our secur servic and our politician if they do not have evid to bring these peopl to trial there probabl isn ani our secur servic behav like the detect who have decid that certain person is guilti rake over all kind of obscur and flimsi evid to tri and prove it while the real villain get away rememb there were no wmd in iraq just becaus person may have made some stupid and naiv decis in life doe not make them terrorist in thi overli polit correct societi it is good to see someon like mr forsyth speak out ye there ha been oppress by the british govern in the past and overstep the mark in place like ireland but ye we are still democraci where it is rare to be arrest without charg trial etc apart from number of prison in belmarsh goal for exampl thi countri sign up to human right and then pretend that they onli appli to the peopl with noth to fear the innoc peopl defin by whom when id card becom mandatori the data collect will not be protect by the data protect act and will be readili avail to peopl like gchq with no control by the person whose id is be check the threat now is new you cannot compar the threat of past year with now forsyth say die over year or terror peopl die in one morn in ny on septemb th the threat today is that terrorist will acquir nuclear or biolog technolog kilo of semtex will flatten build kilo of plutonium will flatten citi you now have combin of peopl who will perform terrorist act with technolog that is rapidli becom access agre the govern is probabl encourag degre of mass hysteria and talk up the threat but talk down the threat and do noth is unaccept too the problem with thi issu is not that it isn import but the fact that in gener we brit can be so polit apathet some time that we will just let thi go without tell the govern no howev as the nation that gave the world the common law and true sens of the right of individu liberti hope thi will prove to be one step too far as somebodi of chines origin can say that thi countri use to be good place to migrat and start new life whilst life wasn perfect we could make better for ourselv now we are riddl with red tape and be told what we can or cannot do we have to be polit correct and we are not allow to have belief or opinion we have prime minist who spend too much time meddl in us polit and affair which have littl to do with the live of british citizen at home or abroad mr forsyth ha done good job in voic hi opinion let hope the bbc doesn get gag for let peopl express their view the peopl have the right to know and the bbc role is to inform educ and entertain agre terrorist intend to spread fear but in realiti it is the govern which ha spread the fear by it constant publicis of the thi invis enemi so danger that we must allow them to ride roughshod over our right and liberti in the end the veri thing we seek to protect is what we are give up in the name of safeti from thi invis enemi the terrorist have alreadi won absolut agre with frederick forsyth ye we have to defend ourselv against terror but exist law seem to be more than adequ the idea that the new terror demand new power is erron the evid of ani real terrorist capabl in the uk is scant ricin for exampl is danger poison but it is not weapon of mass destruct what is realli worri is the enthusiasm of mr blair and hi govern for authoritarian reaction and attempt to manipul the elector through fear if the govern ha it way with id card track and so on then totalitarian ha won and as such it then matter littl whether we give in to the terrorist demand or not we will have lost the preciou freedom which bush and blair constantli tell us we have and that they seek to bring to other agre wholeheartedli with mr forsyth am shock at the eas with which thi govern is prepar to wipe out major portion of the liberti that british peopl have enjoy for centuri the right not to be depriv of our liberti without trial in open court that goe right back to magna carta and ordinari peopl have spill their blood to enforc that right against govern who thought they knew best when you look at today britain you realis georg orwel wa onli wrong about one thing the date frederick forsyth put it beauti the govern is seek to introduc polic state the new power of home intern without trial follow pattern which includ the introduct of surveil via compulsori id card and the link of data base togeth with the un british idea that we will have to swear allegi to the state at the age of year we are sleep walk into thi wake up an interest view but miss two crucial fact of thi new threat if these terrorist acquir weapon of mass destruct they will use them without fear of mutual assur destruct that kept the cold war in state of tens balanc these peopl will use devast forc against us without fear of ani consequ the terrorist are prepar to use suicid bomber which mean they could kill innoc peopl on the london underground and we could do veri littl to stop it becaus these terrorist are potenti so deadli we have to come up with new tougher respons it will be littl late in the day when peopl outsid london wake up one morn to find out that london ha been nuke we won have much of societi left to debat he correct in most of what he say mind you he doe seem to have forgotten that disgrac intern polici in northern ireland which probabl caus mani idealist if misguid young cathol to join the ira administr detent of muslim could have similar effect now sure we the public would be better protect if the secur servic rather than alert suspect terrorist by place them under hous arrest and for how long they were to place suspect terrorist under surveil and mayb acquir suffici evid to prosecut or even better prevent terrorist attack don usual have much time for mr forsyth larg right wing view but thi time he ha got it spot on there is no doubt that there are terrorist organis who would like to do harm to the but it is veri doubt whether al qaeda is global organis co ordin thi the rise of surveil camera id card the plan to charg for road use by track everi vehicl at all time thi is the stuff of nightmar add to thi thi new legisl which effect mean that the protect of the law will be remov from anyon at the whim of the home secretari and genuin wonder what sort of world my two children will inherit where will thi end as it stand terrorist do not need to attack the it govern will soon have it peopl terroris more that they could veri achiev with few bomb mr forsyth ha express exactli what my gut fear and reserv were about thi propos legisl but could not verbalis thank you mr forsyth seem to forget that kill in the troubl occur on both side of the religi divid and wa carri out by killer from both side he also forget basic human right were suspend then as now experienc judg sat over some of the greatest miscarriag of justic dure those time for veri littl return and maximum alien these law and the emphasi on the islam threat will just do the same forsyth is wrong the natur of the current threat is new it is no longer to our arm forc as the soviet threat in the eastern bloc wa it is to you and the terrorist aim to kill the best comparison is therefor the blitz at thi time let us not forget suspect foreign and british were routin round up and intern for the durat of the war without ani complaint from the public we must not forget we are at war say that that the likelihood of an attack by sleeper cell of fundamentalist lunat against major uk target is when not an if probabl ll bet ani money you like that the day after ani such attack freddi forsyth will be say that the govern didn do enough to protect the uk peopl like forsyth can onli see one side of ani argument and for him it is the side that is opposit new labour and toni blair agre wholeheartedli with mr forsyth the veri reason thi countri ha been such wonder place to live is under attack not from terrorist but from thi govern the perpetu of the perceiv terrorist threat is not becaus of what the alleg terrorist are do but from our own govern believ what thi govern is do is at the veri least highli question and at worst sinist at what point will they feel they have enough control over everi singl person in the british isl when we are all tag and monitor constantli our freedom is be craftili and surreptiti whittl away by thi govern and we are gain noth it should be of great concern to everyon am slightli older than mr forsyth and therefor have live through the same histori as him am against polic state and would not like to think that live in one think that the attack on iraq made the intern situat wors and may have provok further act of terror how true there are extrem worri parallel between britain now and germani dure the never thought it would be so easi to take over countri from within mr forsyth ha forgotten one key point the terrorist who threaten britain today are well awar that hitler stalin and the ira all fail as result modern day terrorist are will to do thing their predecessor did not that doe not mean that the civil liberti of modern britain must be erod to counter the threat that should alway be the absolut last resort but to meet the new threat to defeat the sinist fanatic of today terrorist we may need to do thing littl differ let us hope not freder forsyth comment seem to me to be well thought out analysi of whi we human societi as whole and britain in particular should resist the temptat to over protect through fear it is thi fear which enabl terrorist to succeed in the end and terrorist can come in all form as mr forsyth open comment suggest am remind of quot attribut to thoma jefferson nation that limit freedom in the name of secur will have neither the govern are face with an incred difficult task and have made polici to deal with it it all veri well criticis that polici but if mr forsyth can draw on hi year of experi to offer an altern say so what to hi opinion frederick forsyth rhetor is absurd and hi conclus laughabl he distort realiti to serv hi own prejudic against new labour thi govern seek to balanc protect of our democraci with minimum loss of civil right it is frederick forsyth who is the extremist becaus he doe not appreci the need for balanc rare find myself agre with my forsyth but in thi instanc think he is correct the rule of law must prevail civil liberti are worth defend if the govern can hold suspect without charg or trial what next agre absolut by introduc fascist type law we loos the moral high ground in our fight against terror our democrat system is not perfect but as churchil point out it is better than all the other that have been tri terrorist attack will take place but for mani reason we should take that person risk in return for person freedom do not usual agre with mr forsyth but he is spot on here the singl biggest threat we face is that of govern dedic to act illeg and manipul intern and nation law to suit it own purpos totalitarian alway requir an outsid threat justifi rang of extraordinari power leader want the british govern is far greater threat that and terrorist organis although in principl agre with him frederick forsyth fail to address one key point al qaeda attack though obvious there have been none yet in the uk seek to kill the maximum number of peopl the ira want to limit the death toll of their attack so as to maintain support among the republican movement ye agre with mr forsyth view do not believ the govern plan are justifi there is over reaction to and the neg influenc of the us presid interpret of democraci and freedom he use the same argument that were current befor the wwii the war to liber iraq afghanistan with syria and iran to come we are leav poor inherit for the futur gener mr forsyth is wonder writer and should keep hi fiction where it belong the british govern is not go down the road that mr forsyth suggest sadli comment such as hi will make lot of peopl believ that they are govern by peopl who are fast becom tyrant instead of be genuin commit to stop tyranni even if the method employ to do that is at the moment alien to the british peopl who have live in democraci protect by toni blair and other of like mind who mr forsyth seem to be put along side the scruffi littl austrian thoma hobb would be smile in hi grave at labour proposit like new labour he call himself libertarian like new labour he believ he wa promot the peopl best interest but as forsyth criticis thi govern hobb ha been criticis by most subsequ philosoph for argu hi way into the hand of the totalitarian simpli put he argu that in favour of the ultim liberti the liberti to live man should be prepar to surrend all other liberti to suprem sovereign as protect against hi fellow barbar man hobb ha been roundli condemn by poster and rightli so hope new labour suffer the same treatment agre with mr forsyth view the govern approach is total against the spirit of british democraci they must not be allow to get away with it of cours frederick is wrong about britain win the war against the ira and he wrong too about the countri not becom tyranni ha he forgotten about shoot to kill tortur intern without trial collus with loyalist death squad etc my background is somewhat similar to freddi so am persuad to agre with mani of hi sentiment we can have no moral justif for impos our system of govern on anyon while we are systemat depriv our own citizen of basic individu and collect freedom whilst the principl of keep potenti terrorist under hous arrest might seem superfici attract it is unfortun also the first step toward totalitarian who is to decid whom is suspect whi should we believ them who can have faith in the honesti integr and compet of our intellig servic and politician in light of the event of recent year what is to stop fals denunci what of those fals accus who will lose their career who will support their famili will their children still go to school it smack to me of the method of nazi germani stalin russia ceausescu romania the list goe on it look as if new dark age is come see that opinion on mr forsyth remark are divid the problem see is that those who support imprison without trial believ it will never happen to them or their famili onli to peopl they don like or are scare of but histori ha shown that if you have law like that they alway get abus by those in power after all today you may be scare of the same peopl as those in power but someday those in power may be scare of you and that day you ll be the one imprison without the chanc of justic our law are such that you cannot just be imprison at the whim of our polic forc you have to be shown to be deserv of it if we imprison peopl without trial for an indetermin period we are no better that those we are fight never thought it possibl for me to agre with singl word utter by frederick forsyth but in wholeheart agreement with him on thi one we as nation are in grave danger of be dupe by pro us propaganda which of cours also mean we ll inherit most if not all of their total paranoia and allow our govern of ani polit persuas incident to gradual and insidi impos polic state by well tri test back door method griev for the futur of my children it no wonder they re adam they don ever want ani of their own thi govern with much fanfar sign us up to the european convent on human right but now want to introduc indefinit hous arrest without trial thi put it on par with the govern of burma like mani of your respond wouldn usual think of mr forsyth as someon whose view share but in the instanc of oppos charl clark propos for hous arrest agre wholeheartedli with mr forsyth agre with mr forsyth just look at the fact our govern along with the us invad anoth sovereign countri iraq by select intellig that back it case base on fear the fact turn out to be veri differ if individu are treat in the same distort way then we ve done ourselv more damag than ani terrorist organis could with bomb we becom anim too agre in mani way with what mr forsyth ha said if we are to be respect and have influenc within the world we must be seen to be walk the walk as well as talk the talk how can we accus countri such as zimbabw and burma of human right abus when we are lock up peopl who may be total innoc it is hypocrisi of the highest order mr forsyth link islam fundament to the new threat howev it appear that he ha misunderstood the term islam fundament it should be point out that muslim who adher to the true fundament of the qur aan and the teach of the last prophet muhammad is an islam fundamentalist thi person doe not commit suicid in ani shape or form nor doe she he kill innoc women men and children thi person is self reflect and constantli tri to better her hi action by be good to other the peopl who mr forsyth label the new threat are those who do not follow the correct teach of islam they have arriv at their own interpret and assumpt with regard their action on top of that they claim to be follow islam in it true form accept that the intent of these polici are to make britain safer place but cannot think of singl exampl from histori where do thi sort of thing ha ever made ani differ in northern ireland intern certainli didn achiev anyth the bomb didn stop and it could be argu that all it achiev wa to just suppli the ira with yet more angri and resent republican will to take up arm against the british be eight year older than frederick forsyth and survivor of the blitz on london it is easi to agre with him he is absolut spot on dure the ira bomb there were massiv explos in canari wharf to the right of where write thi and also to the left in the citi of london notwithstand these and the attempt and nearli success assassin attempt on prime minist thatcher in brighton and on later occup of down street there wa no retaliatori blitz on belfast or dublin as there ha been on afghanistan and iraq even when england wa in true peril in apart from some detent there were no wholesal derog of habea corpu and the like we have to see off these latest attempt on our liberti includ id card which winston churchil decid had to go sinc he said the averag bobbi on the beat could not be reli on to not be tempt to take undu advantag against the citizen go about their law activ incident can still rememb my old id card number henc

parri put gerrard abov money listen to the full interview on sport on five and the bbc sport websit from gmt but parri speak exclus to bbc sport also admit gerrard who ha been constantli link with chelsea will have the final say on hi futur he told bbc five live steven is abov money he is the futur of liverpool it doesn matter if it or we will not accept offer but we are also realist enough to know we can keep steven against hi will on the subject of liverpool financ parri also reveal the club is readi to explor the possibl of sponsorship deal for it propos new stadium and respond to critic from bbc sport pundit and former liverpool stalwart alan hansen he insist talk on new invest are ongo but ad the door ha not close on sharehold and lifelong fan steve morgan parri join liverpool as chief execut in juli from similar role at the premier leagu there have been sever high and low dure hi time in charg at anfield and he had busi summer overse the arriv of new manag rafael benitez and manag to hold on to steven gerrard on the subject of liverpool captain and prize asset parri reveal real madrid did ask for an option on the england midfield man dure negoti for striker fernando morient he said they were look for way of say they got more out of the deal for fernando morient but the respons to real madrid wa the same steven is not for sale but when ask if gerrard would be liverpool player on the first day of next season parri said sincer hope he will be steven know my view he know rafa view we have re affirm recent to steven that we are tri to build team around him we crave success as much as he doe we know he ambiti and nobodi can argu with that think steven would dearli love to win thing with liverpool more than he like to do anyth els we all want to see progress by next season he not alon in that there are lot of other player who feel the same so we all have common aim it is expect chelsea will test liverpool with plu bid in the summer but parri claim he will be in no mood to listen there have been lot of open secret about steven most of which have been complet myth it is suggest we had deal tie up last summer we didn had an offer last summer parri explain we had told chelsea that as far as we were concern he wa not for sale and we didn want to sell him in realiti it didn go beyond that mayb there will be an offer in the summer mayb there won our posit is we want steven to stay but we are also realist enough and have enough respect for steven and he ha enough respect for us to know that it is hi decis that will be crucial you are not go to keep player like steven against hi will that just doesn work but ani idea we are go to accept offer for steven and then tell him by the way we ve decid to sell you is not on the agenda you can forget that parri is current in the process of finalis fund for liverpool new stadium in stanley park which is set to open in and he confess arsen deal with emir to sponsor their new ground complet with name right ha given the anfield club seriou food for thought he said have to say histor it is someth have been against and have been on record as say that but think the size of the arsen deal is real eye open would say in the past deal have been done frankli far too cheapli and it just hasn even been worth contempl but the arsen deal is the sort of deal that caus you to draw breath and say wow that interest my person point of view is that would find it hell of lot more palat than share stadium some liverpool fan would find such move highli controversi but parri counter recognis it would be an emot issu for mani support but you look at the amount of money avail and it could go into the team if it wa the right partner how strong an issu is it time will tell think the stadium will alway be anfield not least becaus of where it is but do we need to investig the possibl of sponsorship think it would be remiss not to that not to say we have made decis that we will go down that road but think it is clearli someth we have to explor on the subject of possibl new invest parri reveal liverpool are still in negoti with mysteri investor with rumour of interest from the middl east that prompt the withdraw of tycoon steve morgan who got frustrat by fail bid and what he claim wa indecis by the board he also accus liverpool of use him as stalk hors to attract other bid but parri explain steve ha never been use as stalk hors there no need and that is not the way we do busi we had discuss with steve over the cours of think we came close to conclud deal in the summer but it didn happen quit genuin the new interest did appear rel late in the day just prior to the agm in decemb and as have said it wa of such potenti magnitud and that potenti is so excit we felt we had to evalu it we are still evalu it steve interest wa taken veri much on it own merit hi enthusiasm for the club is there for all to see and who know what the next few month will hold the door isn close on anyth we had perfectli sensibl dialogu with steve last year we have common interest in make liverpool success that dream we all share so as far as concern the door is not close would take if we had no invest but if we did keep him as for the stadium if it get us cash what differ doe it make realli for gerrard don care who you are the director would take the money and it is the way it should be we cannot let that sum of money go despit gerrard qualiti through cleverli word statement the club ha effect forc gerrard to publicli make the decis for himself which think is the right thing to do critic time for liverpool with regard to gerrard ideal we would want to secur hi futur to the club for the long term am hope he doesn walk out of the club like michael owen did for veri littl cash realist would allow rafa to complet rebuild the squad howev if we can afford to do thi and keep gerrard we will be better for it would howev be happi with gerrard transfer for ani fee over parri statement are clever in that ani futur gerrard transfer cannot be constru as lack of ambit by the club to not tri and keep their best player up the ant is anoth smart move by parri would keep gerrard no amount of money could replac hi obviou love of the club and determin to succeed the key is if gerrard come out and say that he is happi clearli if he isn then we would be foolish not to sell the

brit debat over urban music joss stone year old soul singer from devon beat dizze rascal jamelia lemar and the street to win best british urban act at the brit award her victori ha reignit the debat about what urban music is not realli comfort with the word urban it word that been manufactur in thi countri and america to describ black music the word urban seem to cover such broad rang of black music that it wrong how far are the brit remov from inner citi music and what peopl are do it so far remov that don expect them to get it bang on the music industri isn champion music from our particular genr veri well anyway peopl don feel like that anyth to do with us don feel like urban music just been celebr by joss stone win or her be nomin or by the brit acknowledg that there an urban music scene becaus it all kick in the teeth at the end of the day it not realli relev if joss stone is the closest thing that they feel comfort champion becaus of what she look like and how she sound and who she sign to then so be it it got noth to do with what realli go on urban as genr is veri broad if you look underneath urban there are number of core element that includ hip hop garag and into that obvious come soul joss stone is soul artist her first album wa call the soul session so urban is veri broad brushstrok that is the umbrella over the top of sub genr and there are offshoot of all of those joss stone ha had amaz success in the us given that she uk artist what ha realli captur everybodi imagin is that here you have year old from devon with voic to die for and bunch of realli realli good tune and she look good think that what done it the award for best british urban act wa vote for by viewer of mtv base don think joss wa not worthi winner she make soul music and that definit come under the categori of what we describ as urban the fact that she from devon is the interest thing becaus most of the music we cover is made in larg citi and she liter rural the great thing about urban music is that there big rang if there is some sort of root with black music or danc music in britain think that where you can call it urban that where thi new sub categori or uber categori ha come from joss stone is certainli not old enough to have had some of the experi of an older soul singer but you couldn argu that she wa be inauthent with her emot it is come from somewher genuin it ha to come across as real that the onli cut off point we have here and that the onli way by which we judg peopl what urban mean to us as an organis is the polit correct term to describ music which origin from black background music should becom inclus and if we are fight for multi cultur britain then we should be fight for inclus rather than exclus if joss stone can be accept within the urban music commun think act from other ethnic do classic music and rock should be accept too race doesn make differ if everyon is includ out of all the award dish out yesterday still tri to find out what peopl of other race receiv ani sort of recognit or award type of music especi street music that origin from citi and typic reflect or is characterist of urban life she might not be urban but when did becom the hip hop taint thing it is now stand for rhythm and blue rememb that joss stone is rubbish is certain if anyon deserv to win an award for urban music think probabl should includ hip hop soul funk at least but not rock or pop thi year it the street although dizze rascal stake good claim she definit deserv to win prize joss stone album are quit simpli amaz easili better than anyth els that wa releas last year thi whole debat about what is urban what isnt urban is complet pointless and probabl fuel by urban artist who weren nomin or didn win cant see whi peopl can just congratul her for the talent that she is she did deserv it but agre with the comment about urban music it stupid phrase and particularli british in the state they tend to use hip hop and if say hip hop here lot of peopl have no idea what talk about veri strang what in name rose by ani other name etc if peopl want to call it urban whi not if we realli analys it the term danc music is mislead becaus it doesn describ everyth you can danc to whilst agre that the term urban is open to interpret it strike me as simpli weird that joss stone ha won urban to me is what hear be play in parti in the inner citi live in brixton and have never heard the soul session pump out of of bass heavi sound system in ani parti ve been to good luck to joss stone let celebr her victori let also question whi with artist so success and talent as jamelia lemar kany west dizze rascal alicia key and outkast we didn see singl black artist on stage collect an award so what you re say is that ani music that ha black heritag is not allow to be sung by anyon who isn black and if it is then they shouldn be acknowledg for it even if they re pretti dam good at it she ha an amaz voic and won good on her oh but she not black well let make her feel real bad about it then how dare she though hang on didn the so call public vote on thi one thi idea of pigeonhol whatev is popular at the time is no differ than what wa happen in the and in relat to what jazz wa the media then call anyth that had swing beat syncop melodi or soul feel jazz much to the chagrin of the artist it would mean that blue would be put in the same mould as bebop cool and ragtim all veri differ style at that time jazz wa and remain such massiv misunderstood term and so what of urban music in truth it lazi term to categoris music that you don realli understand soul and garag are world apart music marvin gay tuff jam but no doubt have their connect if we just let the music speak for itself and not judg the success of an artist by the number of award won then mayb we can enjoy the music for what it is rather than what it repres demand prize for rural music suck to the citi it way better out here we have hay for one thing exclud her from what ha becom known as urban music would be as bad as exclud lenni kravitz or hendrix from rock music for be black sure dont understand the point that ty is make if lemar who make music which is less soul than joss work won he might have said noth btw black too how can she be urban if she spent most of her life in the devon countrysid nonsens love joss to bit and don care what her brand is it amaz music full stop stop pute it all in bracket and let just call it music and let especi drop the black urban tag nearli all music came from black origin thi just set an exampl that it is ok to pigeonhol peopl and their music by their colour sure the point of have an urban music categori is simpli to acknowledg artist that are make what is histor consid urban music irrelev of the colour of their skin or where they origin from joss stone is simpli sing certain type of music that can be consid urban in style just as someon from an inner citi and inde not from the usa could sing countri music if that person wa good at it and authent in sound would we criticis it be refer to as countri music or the artist for repres that style the term urban in refer to music genr in uk ha develop in part from the controversi surround the brand of the mobo award the veri term music of black origin ha confus and offend mani peopl thi is particularli strang given the exist of the asian music award it appear that the use of black or white in relat to music make peopl feel uncomfort the term urban therefor ha been invok to sidestep the debat of which type of music came first black or white therebi render the issu colourblind the result is now redund new debat as to what urban also mean perhap we should have creat new term altogeth to describ the variou strain of soul rnb and hip hop one which doe not also mean someth els as we have done with crunk urban is just word that come about recent to describ black music that becom popular now the word wasn even in use or common use five of six year ago it just way of the industri clump it all togeth without have to call it black music becaus some peopl are oversensit and might call them racist for it in band that ha been call urban and despis the label hate to think belong to ani neat market nich becaus that all it is ever sinc the music channel and record comapni tri to fractur what they consid music of black origin these label have been use to undermin the statu of good music into commod look at all the tv broadcast unabl to reach young peopl without condesend they simpli play some urban music on the soundtrack as if it some dread cheap lift music ignor the label it is what it is just music as black man think agre with some of the statement at least the statement made by the key execut black peopl should lead the music they invent we should stop call genr meaningless north is meaningless the real question is would joss stone would have been that success do the music she wa do if she were black same thing with street ami winehous etc who ever heard of terri walker or rhian benson they are both time better than joss stone and both of them have won urban music award and think mobo but whi not brit so what if joss stone won the urban award her music is great soul and sure that is under the urban banner what if the street had won would peopl be whine becaus mike skinner is white it seem that lot of the fuss is about race where the real issu should be music and noth els urban is pc version for say black music not doubt ms stone talent but whi didn jamelia or lemar get brit thi remind me of what happen to craig david and soul ii soul in the past get nomin are easi to get but pick up brit seem to be the hardest thing refresh to see peopl make reason intellig comment on ani topic these day more power to you peopl you have said it there is music you like and music you don like who care what label you put on it that entir categori wa mess how can you have peopl like dizze rascal up against joss stone it like put eminem against bob geldof she should have been nomin for best british act joss stone deserv to win an award for her talent but don think it wa veri urban of her to sing angel with robbi william urban is nonsens term music of black origin well doesn that includ rock music made in the inner citi well almost all band end up make music in london manchest etc and doesn that make some weird implic that all black peopl live in citi it doesn make ani sens whi doe music have to be put into genr it music you like it or you don simpl as that play in heavi metal band we are urban music as far as concern we live in citi and spend our work life in an urban environ it therefor directli shape what we write music urban seem to be the new name for all style of black music whi it need rebrand don know as the name is mislead oasi origin from citi and characteris the urban life they know therefor more than fit the term urban yet as they re white rock band they won be describ as such joss stone ha fantast voic and great time and deliveri what other reason do they need to award her the brit all thi urban and other such categoris is just the red tape of the music busi and is best ignor yeah she deserv it she is talent urban is crap meaningless polit correct and probabl actual racist market term though there onli two kind of music good and bad,1

be care how you code new european direct could put softwar writer at risk of legal action warn former programm and technolog analyst bill thompson if it get it way the dutch govern will conclud it presid of the european union by push through controversi measur that ha been reject by the european parliament lack major support from nation govern and will leav million of european citizen in legal limbo and face the possibl of court case against them if the new law wa about border control defenc or even the new constitut then our tv screen would be full of expert agonis over the impact on our daili live sadli for those who will be directli affect the controversi concern the patent of comput program topic that may excit the blogger campaign group and technic press but doe not obsess middl britain after all how much fuss can you gener about the direct on the patent of comput implement invent and the way it amend articl of the european patent convent yet if the new direct is nod through at the next meet of one of the eu ministeri council as seem like it will allow program to be patent in europ just as they are in the us mani observ of the comput scene includ myself think the result will be disastr for small compani innov programm and the free and open sourc softwar movement it will let larg compani patent all sort of idea and give legal forc to those who want to limit their competitor use of realli obviou idea in the us you cannot build system that store custom credit card detail so that they can pay without have to re enter them unless amazon let you becaus they hold the patent on one click onlin purchas it is small invent but amazon made it to the patent offic first and now own it we are rel free from thi sort of thing over here but perhap not for long the new propos go back to although argument about patent of softwar and comput implement invent ha been go on sinc at least the mid they have come to head now after year in which propos were made endors by the council of minist radic modifi by the european parliament and then re present in their origin form some nation govern seem to be awar of the problem poland ha reject the propos and germani main polit parti have oppos it but there is not enough opposit to guarante their reject earli in decemb the british govern held consult meet with those who had comment on the propos scienc minist lord sainsburi went along to listen and outlin the uk posit but accord to those present it wa embarrass to see how littl the minist and hi offici actual understood the issu concern the draft direct is be put through the council as what is call an item and can onli be approv or reject no discuss or amend is allow so whi should we be worri first there is the abus of the democrat process involv in disregard the view of the parliament and abandon all of their care argu amend thi goe to the heart of the european project and even those who do not care about softwar or patent should be worri if coder are treat like thi today who is to say that it will not be you tomorrow more directli onc softwar patent are grant then ani programm will have to worri that the code they are write is infring someon els patent thi is not about steal softwar as code is alreadi protect by copyright patent are not copyright but someth much stronger patent give the owner the right to stop anyon els use their invent even if the other person invent it separ have never to my shame manag to read lord byron child harold pilgrimag if it wa point out that one of my articl contain substanti chunk of the poem then could defend myself in court by claim that had simpli made it up and it wa coincid the same doe not hold for patent if sit down thi afternoon and write brilliant graphic compress routin and it happen to be the same as the lzw algorithm use in gif file then am in troubl under patent law at least in the us coincid is no defenc the propos direct is support by mani of the major softwar compani but thi is hardli surpris sinc most of them are us base and they have alreadi had to cope with legal environ that allow patent they have legal depart and more crucial patent of their own which they can trade or cross licens with other patent holder even thi system break down of cours as microsoft found out last year when they initi lost case brought by eola which claim that internet explor and other browser infring an eola patent that one wa eventu thrown out but onli after month of uncertainti and million of dollar but small compani and the free and open softwar movement do not have ani patent to trade much of the realli use softwar we use everi day program like the apach web server the gnu linux oper system and the fearsom popular firefox browser is develop outsid compani structur by peopl who do not have legal depart to check for patent infring the damag to softwar will not happen overnight of cours if the direct goe through it ha to be written into nation law and then there will be steadi stream of legal action against small compani and open sourc product eventu someon will decid to attack linux directli probabl with some secret fund from one or two larg player the new direct will limit innov by forc programm to spend time check for patent infring or simpli avoid work in potenti competit area and it will damag europ comput industri we can onli hope that the council of
